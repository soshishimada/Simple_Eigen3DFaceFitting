# Simple Eigen 3D Face Fitting
Quite simple python3 implementation for eigen 3D face fitting

![](outputs.png)
- Run PCA_FACE.ipynb to apply fitting to the target 3D face using the eigen 3D faces. The program saves the result and mean face.
- The dimensionality reduction is done using PCA.
- "Dim" in the image represents the number of eigen vectors used for the fitting.
- The dataset is taken from [here](http://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/)
